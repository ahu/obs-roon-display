# OBS Roon Display
Simply Roon extension to display what's playing in each zone. Intended to be used for OBS as an overlay when playing music while streaming.

Note that I don't really intend to make this more configurable at this point due to time restrictions...

## TODO
* Dockerize
* Some more documentation

## Running with debug loggin
Try something like `DEBUG=server*,roon:* npm start`.
